### Problem Statement
Elderly individuals face heightened risks of falls and medical emergencies due to age-related health issues, reduced mobility, and chronic conditions. Timely assistance is critical, yet traditional systems fail to provide real-time monitoring and effective emergency responses, especially in independent living scenarios.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed **IoT-Based Comprehensive Elderly Monitoring System** incorporates real-time monitoring, fall detection, and emergency alert mechanisms, ensuring enhanced safety for elderly individuals. Key features include:

1. **Fall Detection:** Leveraging the MPU 6050 accelerometer and gyroscope for precise motion sensing.
2. **Emergency Alert Mechanism:** Integration of audible alarms, SMS notifications, and cloud-based monitoring for instant response.
3. **Manual Distress Alert:** A panic button for users to signal emergencies.
4. **Cloud Connectivity:** Remote monitoring via NodeMCU ensures caregivers have access to real-time data.
