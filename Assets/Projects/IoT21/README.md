## Title: IoT-Based Automated Fertilizer Dispensing System for Real-Time Nutrient Optimization in Agriculture

*Problem Statement:* Agriculture faces challenges in achieving efficient crop growth while minimizing environmental harm due to inefficient fertilizer application methods. Overuse or underuse of nutrients harms soil health, reduces yields, and increases costs, while excessive runoff leads to water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The absence of precise, real-time monitoring and automated solutions exacerbates nutrient imbalances, failing to account for diverse soil conditions and crop requirements. An IoT-Based Automated Fertilizer Dispensing System can address these issues by leveraging smart sensors to monitor soil conditions and automate precise fertilizer delivery, optimizing resource use and promoting sustainable farming practices.

*Hardware Requirements:* <br>
- NPK Soil Sensor <br>
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2 <br>
- Solenoid Valve <br>
- Water Pump <br>
- Sprayer System <br>
- Raspberry Pi <br>
- GSM module (SIM800) <br>
- Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32) <br>
- Battery <br>
- Breadboard <br>

Sustainable Development Goals:

1. SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The system reduces waste and promotes efficient use of fertilizers, supporting sustainable consumption and production patterns.
2. SDG 13: Climate Action
By minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from excessive fertilizer use and runoff, the system contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.
